 abstract = {School-based teams are a core method for stakeholder
collaboration and coordination. Although school teams are
responsible for making numerous decisions, a limited number of
measures exist to support the evaluation of these meetings, none
of which span the full range of hypothesized meeting quality
variables (e.g., meeting structure, use of data). In response,
an instrument was developed and evaluated for measuring
perceptions of team meetings by school-based personnel. After
expert content validation and cognitive pretesting took place,
277 respondents completed the 46-item measure in its entirety.
Respondents were mostly female (n = 164, 59%) and taught
general education (n = 111, 40%). Results from an Exploratory
Factor Analysis suggested that, contrary to the hypothesized
model, respondents completed the measure in a manner that
suggested a three-factor solution consisting of Goals and Data,
Facilitator Effectiveness, and Interpersonal Perception. A
smaller set of broader constructs may be more appropriate for
future instrumentation.},
