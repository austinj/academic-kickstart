 abstract = {Implementation of research-based, Tier 1 behavior management
strategies can be monitored to provide data-driven feedback and
in support of integrity. The Measure of Active Supervision and
Interaction (MASI) was developed to measure four behavior
management practices (i.e., Praise, Correction, References to
Behavior Expectations, Active Supervision) using systematic
direct observation. This study was designed to address research
questions related to reliability and validity by applying the
MASI to evaluate staff behavior in seven out-of-school time
programs. Findings indicate that two raters can complete the
MASI with high agreement. Ratings are attributable largely to
desirable sources of variance, and content validators positively
rate the measure. Results are nonsignificantly correlated with
established implementation measures for Positive Behavior
Interventions and Supports.},
