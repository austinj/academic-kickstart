 abstract = {Reliable and valid data form the foundation for evidence-based
practices, yet surprisingly few studies on school-based
behavioral assessments have been conducted which implemented one
of the most fundamental approaches to construct validation, the
multitrait-multimethod matrix (MTMM). To this end, the current
study examined the reliability and validity of data derived from
three commonly utilized school-based behavioral assessment
methods: Direct Behavior Rating - Single Item Scales, systematic
direct observations, and behavior rating scales on three common
constructs of interest: academically engaged, disruptive, and
respectful behavior. Further, this study included data from
different sources including student self-report, teacher report,
and external observers. A total of 831 students in grades 3-8 and
129 teachers served as participants. Data were analyzed using
bivariate correlations of the MTMM, as well as single and
multi-level structural equation modeling. Results suggested the
presence of strong methods effects for all the assessment methods
utilized, as well as significant relations between constructs of
interest. Implications for practice and future research are
discussed.},
