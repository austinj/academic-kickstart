 abstract = {The implementation of multi-tiered systems in schools
necessitates the use of screening assessments which produce valid
and reliable data to identify students in need of tiered
supports. Data derived from these screening assessments may be
evaluated according to their classification accuracy, or the
degree to which cut scores correctly identify individuals as
``at-risk'' or ``not-at-risk.'' The current study examined the
performance of mean scores derived from over 1700 students in
Grades 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8 using Direct Behavior Rating-Single
Item Scales. Students were rated across three time points (Fall,
Winter, Spring) by their teachers in three areas: (a)
academically engaged behavior, (b) disruptive behavior, and (c)
respectful behavior. Classification accuracy indices and
comparisons among behaviors were derived using Receiver Operating
Characteristic (ROC) curve analyses, partial area under the curve
(pAUC) tests, and bootstrapping methods to evaluate the degree to
which mean behavior ratings accurately identified students who
demonstrated elevated behavioral symptomology on the Behavioral
and Emotional Screening System. Results indicated that optimal
cut-scores for mean behavior ratings and a composite rating
demonstrated high levels of specificity, sensitivity, and
negative predictive value, with sensitivity point estimates for
optimal cut-scores exceeding .70 for individual behaviors and .75
for composite scores across grade groups and time points.},
