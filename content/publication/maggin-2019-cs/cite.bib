 abstract = {The following paper provides a response to the recent critique
of our review of the FRIENDS For Life anxiety prevention and
intervention program. In their critique, Barrett, Cooper,
Stallard, Zeggio, & Gallegos-Guajardo (2017) expressed concerns
on a range of conceptual, methodological, and interpretative
issues. Our rejoinder addresses each of these points and
reasserts our position that the primary concern with the studies
was the use of the wrong unit of analysis when analyzing the
data. Our response is contextualized in the importance of
rigorous research as an essential component of evidence-based
practice.},
