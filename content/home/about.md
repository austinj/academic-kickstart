As an Assistant Professor at the University of California, Riverside, I serve as the Program Director of our APA-accredited and NASP-approved <a href="https://education.ucr.edu/school-psychology">School Psychology program</a>. I received my PhD in Educational Psychology (with a concentration in School Psychology) from the <a href="https://schoolpsych.education.uconn.edu/">University of Connecticut</a> in 2014. Back in 2007, I graduated summa cum laude with my Bachelor's in Psychology from the University of Arizona. After serving as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow and Project Manager with the IES-funded <a href="http://needs2.education.uconn.edu/">NEEDs2 project</a> from 2014-2015, I joined the Graduate School of Education at the University of California, Riverside. At UCR, I teach undergraduate- and graduate-level courses in behavior assessment and intervention, research, and methodology. I'm a <a href ="https://firstgen.ucr.edu/">first-generation college graduate</a>. I really like my job.

I'm an Associate Editor for the Journal of School Psychology, as well as a licensed psychologist in the state of California (CA #29540) and a Board Certified Behavior Analyst (Certification #1-15-18892).
