## What do we do?

In collaboration with colleagues across the country, we're committed to:

1. Mentoring graduate and undergraduate students towards developing sophisticated research skills that are grounded in real-world problems.
2. Providing teachers and other educators with well-designed, simple, and effective behavior support tools.
3. Understanding the origins of and developing solutions to inequity in school psychology.

## How do you work?

We use weekly stand-up meetings to share progress on individual and shared goals, problem-solve barriers, and spotlight specific projects that could benefit from some more focused discussion. We meet in break-out groups throughout each week to work on individual projects, and use Slack and email to keep each other up to date on our progress.

## Who are we?

We're three faculty members (Drs. [Austin Johnson](#about), [Wesley Sims](https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/wesleys), [Rondy Yu](https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/rondy)) and a rotating team of about 10 to 12 doctoral students in School Psychology and Special Education, some of whom are featured below:
