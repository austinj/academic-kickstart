 abstract = {Many teachers struggle to deliver interventions with sufficient
treatment integrity, perhaps due to implementation variables
that mediate or moderate treatment integrity. Potential
implementation variables have frequently been conceptualized in
ecological frameworks, including the intervention, implementer,
organization, and external environmental levels. Although the
ecological framework is a useful organizational tool, a measure
aligned with this model of implementation variables has not yet
been developed. This article describes the development of the
Assessment of Ecological Implementation Influences (AEII), a
measure to evaluate implementation variables across ecological
levels. Exploratory factor analyses were conducted to evaluate
to what extent responses on the AEII reflect the hypothesized
ecological factor structure. The model of variables from the
intervention to external environment level was not reflected
within the factor structure here. Rather, factors emerged that
were not previously accounted for in the implementation
variables literature. Implications for future research on the
measurement of treatment integrity and implementation variables
are described.},
