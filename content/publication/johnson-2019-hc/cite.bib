 abstract = {To draw informed conclusions from research studies, research
consumers need full and accurate descriptions of study methods
and procedures. Preregistration has been proposed as a means to
clarify reporting of research methods and procedures, with the
goal of reducing bias in research. However, preregistration has
been applied primarily to research studies utilizing group
designs. In this article, we discuss general issues in
preregistration and consider the use of preregistration in
single-case design research, particularly as it relates to
differing applications of this methodology. We then provide a
rationale and make specific recommendations for preregistering
single-case design research, including guidelines for
preregistering basic descriptive information, research
questions, participant characteristics, baseline conditions,
independent and dependent variables, hypotheses, and
phase-change decisions.},
