 abstract = {A two-part systematic review was undertaken to assess the
effectiveness of token economies in increasing rates of
appropriate classroom behavior for students demonstrating
behavioral difficulties. The first part of the review utilized
the recently published What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) standards
for evaluating single-subject research to determine the extent to
which eligible studies demonstrated sufficient evidence to
classify the token economy as an evidence-based practice. The
second part of the review employed meta-analytic techniques
across four different types of effect sizes to evaluate the
quantitative strength of the findings. Methodological strengths
and weaknesses across the studies were systematically
investigated. Results indicated that the extant research on token
economies does not provide sufficient evidence to be deemed
best-practice based on the WWC criteria.},
