abstract: "School-based teams are a core method for stakeholder collaboration and coordination. Although school teams are responsible for making numerous decisions, a limited number of measures exist to support the evaluation of these meetings, none of which span the full range of hypothesized meeting quality variables (e.g., meeting structure, use of data). In response, an instrument was developed and evaluated for measuring perceptions of team meetings by school-based personnel. After expert content validation and cognitive pretesting took place, 277 respondents completed the 46-item measure in its entirety. Respondents were mostly female (n = 164, 59%) and taught general education (n = 111, 40%). Results from an Exploratory Factor Analysis suggested that, contrary to the hypothesized model, respondents completed the measure in a manner that suggested a three-factor solution consisting of Goals and Data, Facilitator Effectiveness, and Interpersonal Perception. A smaller set of broader constructs may be more appropriate for future instrumentation."
